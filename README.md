# IVB: Interactor, View and Builder

IVB is a pragmatic mobile architecture pattern that brings in the essential boundaries into your application without adding much overhead.

This repo contains an iOS weather app that serves as an example.

## Install

You can grab and import the **Common** folder into your app and start building with IVB.

## Templates

To easily create the boilerplate code for the IVB units, simply copy the **Templates/IVB** in this repo to **~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates**. Xcode will now detect the template, and you will see the IVB section once you do *File -> New*.
